# primitive_sorting_AI
This software is a machine learning algorithme that can predicte the type of an object between 2 type that contain 2 parameters.

## Prerequisites
to use this program you need to install python3 ,pip and the numpy lib:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy
```
## How does it work ?
First, the user will choose the number of example in the dataset that the AI will use to train.

Then the user will fill this dataset by giving the values of the 2 parameters for the objects and its type (1 or 0).

After this come the training of the AI, the AI, will train 30000 times. At every training, the output in the dataset and the dataset found by the AI will be printed so you can compare them, and see the evolution of the AI prediction.

Finally, when the training is over, the software print the prediction of the AI.
